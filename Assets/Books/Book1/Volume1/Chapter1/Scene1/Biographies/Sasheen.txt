Sasheen Windstrider is a young wood elf maiden. 
She carries a wooden scimitar at her side and wears a Holy Symbol of Keldin around her arm, across from her tattoo.
Sasheen appears well-acclimated to the desert, unbothered by the heat with suntanned skin which seems unharmed by the coarse sands. 
She raises her hood outside more as a sunblinder than to keep sand from her face.
Her countenance is high and poised as she speaks with authority and quiet confidence, her nerves belied only by her shaking fingertips.
She is the head barista of the Sandy Sphinx tavern in Sandtown,
which is co-owned by her sister Kahleesi and brother Ko'Gath.
